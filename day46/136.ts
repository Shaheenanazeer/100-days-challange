  for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    let variable = i * 2;
    console.log("value of ariable at iteration", i, ":" , variable);
    
    // Logs the current iteration number and the value of 
  }
  // This loop iterates five times, logging the value of 'i' during each iteration to help with debugging.
