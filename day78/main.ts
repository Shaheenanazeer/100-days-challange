// 1. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):
// Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) is a web performance metric that measures the time it takes for the largest content element (such as an image, text block, or video) to become visible in the user's viewport when they access a page. LCP focuses on how long it takes for users to see the most important content, indicating how quickly a page loads. A fast LCP time indicates a good user experience, while a slow LCP time can lead to user frustration and increased bounce rates.

// 2. First Input Delay (FID):
// First Input Delay (FID) is a web performance metric that measures the time it takes for the browser to respond and process the first interaction (such as a click or keyboard input) when a user interacts with a web page for the first time. This is a crucial component of user experience, especially for interactive pages such as forms, buttons, or links. A low FID time means users are getting a responsive and interactive experience, while a high FID time can make users feel frustrated and affect engagement.

// // 3. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):
// // Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) is a web performance metric that measures how much unexpected shifting occurs in the layout of a web page when the page is loading. When elements unexpectedly move (such as due to images or ads loading), it can disrupt users, especially when they are trying to click on an element and it unexpectedly moves. CLS is calculated by using the fraction of the viewport that has shifted for each element and then summing these fractions. A low CLS score means users are getting a consistent and stable layout experience, while a high CLS score can lead to user distraction and confusion.

// It's important for web developers to pay attention to Web Vitals as they provide insights into the performance and user experience of their content and website, and identify areas for improvement to enhance the user experience.
