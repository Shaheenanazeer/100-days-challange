// Question 12: Greetings: Use the array from Exercise 11. Instead of just printing each personâ€™s name, print a message to them. The message should be the same for each person, but personalized with their name.

 

let myName1: string[] = ["sidra", "iqra", "faiza"];
for (let name of myName1) {
    console.log(`Hello ${myName1}, would you like to learn some TypeScript today?`);
}
