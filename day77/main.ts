// SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), TLS (Transport Layer Security), and SSH (Secure Shell) are all protocols used for securing communications over networks, but they serve different purposes and have different characteristics. Here's a brief definition of each:

// ### SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)
// - *Purpose:* SSL is designed to secure the connection between a web server and a web browser.
// - *Function:* It encrypts the data being transmitted to ensure privacy and data integrity.
// - *Usage:* Commonly used for securing HTTP traffic, resulting in HTTPS. 
// - *Status:* SSL has been deprecated due to security vulnerabilities and has been replaced by TLS.

// // ### TLS (Transport Layer Security)
// - *Purpose:* TLS is the successor to SSL and provides more robust security for data in transit.
// - *Function:* Similar to SSL, it encrypts data to protect it from eavesdropping and tampering.
// - *Usage:* Used in a variety of applications such as web browsing (HTTPS), email, instant messaging, and more.
// - *Advancement:* TLS versions 1.2 and 1.3 are widely used, offering improved security and performance over SSL.

// ### SSH (Secure Shell)
// - *Purpose:* SSH is a protocol for securely accessing and managing network devices and servers.
// - *Function:* It provides encrypted channels for secure remote login and other network services over an unsecured network.
// - *Usage:* Commonly used for secure command-line access to remote machines, secure file transfers (via SCP and SFTP), and port forwarding.
// // - *Components:* SSH includes features like secure authentication, encryption of data, and integrity checks to ensure data has not been altered.

// // In summary, SSL and TLS are primarily used to secure data transmissions over the internet, with TLS being the more modern and secure version. SSH, on the other hand, is used for secure remote administration and file transfers.
