On my ideal day,
I wake up before dawn to pray Fajr,
followed by dedicating time to my studies.
Afterwards, I enjoy a hearty breakfast with my family,
sharing moments of joy and laughter.
Then, I perform Zuhr prayer and immerse myself in reciting the Quran.
Next, I spend quality time with my cats,
cherishing their company and playful antics.
Finally, I delve into practicing coding,
continuously honing my skills and embracing the challenges.
