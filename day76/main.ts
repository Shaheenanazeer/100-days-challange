// DNS (Domain Name System)
// DNS is a decentralized naming system for computers, services, or any resource connected to the Internet or a private network. It translates human-readable domain names (like example.com) into numerical IP addresses (like 192.0.2.1) that computers use to identify each other on the network. Without DNS, we would have to remember and type in IP addresses for every website we visit, which is impractical. DNS operates through a distributed database system, with multiple DNS servers around the world storing records that map domain names to IP addresses. When you type a domain name into your web browser, your computer contacts a DNS server to resolve the domain name to the corresponding IP address, allowing your browser to connect to the correct web server.

// DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
// DHCP is a network management protocol used to dynamically assign IP addresses and other network configuration settings to devices on a network. This includes parameters such as subnet mask, default gateway, and DNS server addresses. DHCP simplifies network administration by automatically allocating IP addresses to devices as they connect to the network, eliminating the need for manual configuration. When a device joins a network, it sends a broadcast request for an IP address, and a DHCP server responds with an available IP address from a pool of addresses configured by the network administrator. DHCP also supports lease mechanisms, where IP addresses are leased to devices for a specific period, after which they may be renewed or released back to the pool for reuse. DHCP is widely used in both wired and wireless networks, including home networks, corporate networks, and Internet service provider (ISP) networks.
